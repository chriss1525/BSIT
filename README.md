# Mini Ultimatum Game

Welcome to the Mini Ultimatum Game.

## About 
The Mini Ultimatum Game is a simple web-based application created using the oTree framework. This project allows you to set up and run an ultimatum game involving three players, with Player 1 having the option to send a portion of their starting amount to Player 2. Player 3, an observer, can choose to either punish Player 1, causing both Player 1 and Player 2 to lose their money, or not punish, allowing Player 1 and Player 2 to keep the allocated amounts.
