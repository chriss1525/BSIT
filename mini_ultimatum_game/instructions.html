    <p>Welcome to the Mini ultimatum game</p>
    <p>You are player {{ player.id_in_group }}</p>
    <p>There are 3 players in this game.</p>
    <p>Player 1 has been alloted Ksh 200. He is supposed to offer some of it to Player 2.</p>
    <p>Player 2 should wait to receive money from Player 1.</p>
    <p>Player 3 is the punisher and can see the amount player 1 has offered before it gets to player 2</p>

    <p>
            Depending on how Player 3 feels about the amount, they can choose to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Punish:</strong> If Player 3 punishes Player 1, both Player 1 and Player 2 do not get any money.</li>
            <li><strong>Not Punish:</strong> If Player 3 does not punish Player 1, Player 1 gets their amount - the amount sent to Player 2, and Player 2 gets the amount sent to them by Player 1.</li>
        </ul>      

    <p>This game will be played for {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.</p>
